Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use [1]. 

This course assignments introduces methods for four key aspects of data science:

* Data Acquiring
* Data Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Modelling
  * Classification
  * Anomaly Detection
  * Association Analysis
  * Clustering and more...
